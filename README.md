## Web Application Brief

Your challenge is to create a _Configurable Dashboard for Unattended Displays_.

You are to specify and construct this configurable dashboard using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and any backing store you desire (e.g. a database).


The Unattended Display (C) does not have any inputs (keyboard, mouse, or touch), so any settings must be done remotely, via a server (B) which you must write. The settings tool must be another web page that ought to work on both smartphone (A) and desktop.

Example use cases include:
*the central area in Buckingham Building, where we have a flat panel for displaying information to staff and visitors. A combination of web pages, images, video, and data, could all be displayed. This might include short-lived notifications such as "there's free food in the kitchen" as well as long-term cyclic information, e.g. an advert for the placements office.*

*on the door/wall outside a lecturer's office, there could be a small screen with helpful information for students and staff: e.g., current location/schedule, do-not-disturb, out-of-office, and urgent messages such as be-back-in-five.*

Your task is to show (through your work) the extent to which you have met the learning outcomes for the unit.

The learning outcomes (as defined in the Unit Spec.) are:

1. Identify industry best practices in web application design
	(e.g. client, server and API layers).
2. Design a contemporary web application using industry best practices.
3. Critically evaluate the design and implementation of web applications.
